# Go Backend Learning Archive

This repository is a personal archive of my Go backend learning process.

It contains notes, small projects, and experimental code written while learning Go,
backend development concepts, and related tooling.  
Some parts of the codebase are old and kept intentionally as a record of my learning path.

## Purpose

- Record my Go backend learning journey
- Preserve past experiments and small projects
- Build a long-term technical archive rather than a polished showcase
- Gradually reorganize and improve projects over time

## Contents

- Go language basics and backend experiments
- Small demo projects (e.g. TCP, simple services)
- Notes and learning records
- Legacy code from earlier learning stages

> Third-party dependencies and old GOPATH-style directories are excluded using `.gitignore`.

## Notes

This repository is **not a production-ready project**.  
It is a learning archive that reflects different stages of my understanding.

Some code may be incomplete or outdated, but it is preserved for reference.

## Future Plans

- Gradually refactor selected projects
- Add Docker-based development environments
- Improve project structure and documentation
- Continue updating as learning progresses

Learning is iterative.  
This repository exists to make that process visible.
